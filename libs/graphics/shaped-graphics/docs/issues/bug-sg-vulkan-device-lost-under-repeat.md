# A device loss on the Arc under a repeated sg suite, which an assert turns into an abort

`uv run dev.py test shaped-graphics-test --repeat 20` lost the vulkan device once, on iteration 8, on 2026-11-06 on the Intel Arc B580.
A rerun of 12 iterations passed, and no Windows driver-timeout event (4101) was logged, so nothing shows what lost it.
The test running at the time was `sg - a strong compare-exchange in a pixel stage leaves helper pixels out, and the draw ends`, which is only where the loss was noticed.
Separately, `vulkan_upload_async.cc` asserts on `vkQueueSubmit` rather than marking the device lost, so a loss there aborts the binary instead of failing the test.
