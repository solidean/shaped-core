# Shaped Graphics Language

Our own portable shading language with modern convenience features.

Supports:

* cross compilation to hlsl, hlsl-spirv, wgsl, msl 
* targets dx12, vulkan, metal, webgpu
* self contained tooling for shader live editing
* tight model for integration with `sg`
* polyfills for features like ray-tracing in webgpu
* tooling, syntax highlighting, LSP, etc.
* composability (libraries of shaders)
* advanced in-shader features:
    * per expression traces
    * assertions
    * logging
    * CHECK/REQUIRE for testing

This will also later form the basis of our shader node editing
